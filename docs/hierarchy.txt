ccd_pkg (clock crossing domain) contains the ccd class.

Properties/Members
  Write and read idle counters
  Virtual CCD interface
  Mailboxes for scoreboard
  Randdata is random data that is used for stimulus
  Rand_type is a 2 bit signal to decide if stimulus is all 1's, 0's, or random

  run task
    Calls the compare mailbox (scoreboard) task that will infinitely compare two mailbox items

  Start task with arguments number of writes and data - which accepts a vector of P_DATA_WIDTH size
    Starts a transaction, verifies the number of writes expected to make sure the burst write is not exceded
    Forks a fork begin join, so write and read occur at the same exact time. Loops through the expected number of writes and uses the provided data. This waits for the idle + 1 of the 
    corresponding clock cycles to write or read then calls the write or read task.

  Write Task
    Captures data provided by the argument
    wait for the device to not be full
    assert write enable
    put data in the data in mailbox, but data on the RTL in data line and wait for the falling edge of the clock. 
    deassert write enable

  Read task
    Waits for the fifo to not be empty
    asserts read enable
    negative edge of clock deassert the read enable signal
    place output data in the mailbox

  Get_rand_data function
    get a random number of entries
    if rand mode is 2'b11 use the max burst

    Error checking

    Loop through the number of the number of entries
    use rand type to determine the stimulus to be all 1's, 0's, or random
    Return a vector the the start task to use.

Create clocks, DUT, coverage, connections etc

Loop 300 times generating random data and sending the vectors to the start command to write to the FIFO

Finish
